# City Explorer

**Author**: Asad Hijawi

## Overview

in this app we created a form that takes data input from useres then request a query from an API to get the data requested and then render it using REACT code with components

## Getting Started

1. i made components for App, Headers, Main, Footer
2. in the Main component i made a constructor with a function to get the data from the API
3. i made i a key (ACCESS TOKEN) to use for the GET 
4. i used the GET link with key to get the data for the form such as the name of the location, longtitude, latitude and the map using state and setstate
5. since the response take time i use the asyn with await commands so the app only runs the response is done 
6. then i rendered the form with a submit button using onSubmit even to target the data so it uses the city name entered to make the GET


## Architecture

the application basically has a header of the name of the project which is "City Explorer" and a Main having the form and the data of the location then we have the footer with the copy rights.
technologies used for this app are :
1. REACT
2. Bootstrap
3. AXIOS library 
4. CSS
